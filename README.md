# 📊 Teen Social Media & Mental Health

Exploratory data analysis of how time spent on social media relates to sleep, anxiety and depression in teenagers (ages 13–18).

> **Question:** Is the time teenagers spend on social media associated with worse sleep, higher anxiety and a higher risk of depression? Are some platforms worse than others?

---

## 🔑 Key findings

- 📉 Teens spending **>5 hours/day** on social media sleep on average **6.9 h**, vs **8.6 h** for those with ≤2 h/day — a **1.7-hour deficit**.
- 😰 **Instagram** and **TikTok** users report the highest average anxiety (4.98 and 4.74 / 10).
- 🚨 The depression rate jumps from **22% overall** to **44%** among heavy users (>5 h/day).
- 🛡 **Offline social interaction** is the strongest protective factor in the dataset.

## 📈 Visualisations

### 1. Social media hours vs sleep
![Social media vs sleep](images/01_social_media_vs_sleep.png)

More time on social media is linked to less sleep. Red dots (depressed teens) cluster in the bottom-right — high social-media use and low sleep tend to appear together.

### 2. Anxiety by platform

Instagram and TikTok lead. **Caveat:** their users also spend the most time on the app, so the platform effect may simply be a *time* effect.

### 3. Correlation heatmap

Daily social media hours is the variable most strongly correlated with the depression label (+0.37).

## 🎯 Conclusions

1. **Total time** on social media matters more than *which* platform — the 5 h/day mark is a useful red flag.
2. **Offline interaction** appears protective and deserves more attention than blaming specific apps.
3. **Caveats:** the data is observational (correlation ≠ causation), the depression label is self-reported, and the sample (n = 600) is modest. A follow-up should use longitudinal data and clinical depression assessments.
